## Beginning iOS Development using Swift

In this class we will learn how to build a simple iOS Application using Apples new language, Swift. Since this is a
Beginning class we will dive just far enough into Swift, Xcode and Interface Builder to be able to develop a simple weather application.
We'll look at Xcode's interface, use Interface Builder to layout an interface, learn some beginning Swift language concepts to call out to an API and use a UITableView to display
results. We'll use Storyboards to create the UI and connect UINavigationControllers and UIViewControllers together. We'll look at using ImageAssets to create AppIcons and Images. We'll also look at some common design patterns Apple uses to 
pass data to Controllers. We'll take a look at the changes Apple has made in XCode 8 around Traits and Size classes to make your UI adapt to different Devices.

### What to expect

- An understanding of Xcode's UI
- An overview of Swift
- An understanding of Interface Builder
- How to use Storyboards to link UIViewControllers together
    - How to create an interface
    - How to drag a UI element on a View
    - How to wire up UI elements to a View Controller
- How to create AppIcons of different Sizes
- Build a simple Application


### Environment setup
You will need a Mac and Xcode 8.0. As I'm writing this, XCode 8 is GM. We'll need to install XCode 8 for this class as Apple has made some significant changes to Interface Builder to help developers make their UIs adapt to different form factors.
You will need to come to class with a Mac and Xcode installed.

### [Day One](http://www.tonymerante.com/DayOne) 
We will dive into Xcode's development environment. We'll look at the different Areas you need to develop an application. We'll also look at Interface Builder and its different Areas and
we'll end the class by using what we learned to start building the UI of our Weather Application, using UINavigationControllers, UIViewControllers, UITableViews and Segues.

### [Day Two](http://www.tonymerante.com/DayTwo) 
We'll pickup where we left off on Day One by connecting our Controls to our ViewControllers and getting an understanding of the new way to make our weather application adapt to an iPhone in landscape and portrait.


### [Day Three](http://www.tonymerante.com/DayThree) 
We'll start with understanding some of Apples common Design Patterns and we'll start diving into Swift and learning some of concepts. 
With our understanding of Swift and some Design Patterns under our belt, we'll start coding our application in Swift. We'll call out to a weather API to fetch data and display it on our View.

### [Day Four](http://www.tonymerante.com/DayFour) 
We'll use what we've learned throughout the course and finish up our weather application
