 ####Senior AngularJS/NodeJS Developer

 As a Senior consultant I helped create Verizon Terremark’s next generation web portal, codename ‘SHIELD’, that consolidates two separate cloud service offerings into one single web portal using both AngularJS and NodeJS.

 Was heavily involved in helping Verizon Terremark’s architects create a maintainable client-side architecture. Was instrumental in helping current development staff learn and use GIT as their SCM.

Helped the onboarding of new team members to the project.

Had to reverse engineer both existing web applications, as the SHIELD project has no written requirements. Took mockups from UI/UX team and created client-side code using AngularJS.

Created client-side services that seamlessly mapped both disparate backends into one unified frontend. Created directives to help realize code reuse. Used Highcharts to create resource utilization charts. Created custom HTML5 Canvas Gauge to show resource Allocation.

Helped in project management by suggesting new process flows and tooling.</div>
